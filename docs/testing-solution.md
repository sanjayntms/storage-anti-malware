# Testing the solution

1. Using [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) upload a file to the storage container created by the base infrastructure pipeline

    > **Note:** There are two storage accounts with similar names. Select the **ADLS Gen2** one. The other account, dedicated for the Azure Function app, will not have the test container in it.

For testing the positive detection event, [EICAR test file](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950) can be used.
